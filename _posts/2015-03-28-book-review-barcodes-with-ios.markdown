title: Book Review: Barcodes with iOS
layout: post
---
Recently I had the pleasure of reading Oliver Drobnik's new title Barcodes with iOS so here I am today, eager to start writing a review for it. Once I started reading the book, I realized I know little about barcodes, their evolution, or how to write an application that uses them. The more I was reading, the more I was attracted by this topic and I could not stop reading the book until I finished it.
