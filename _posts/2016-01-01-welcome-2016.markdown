Happy New Year, dear readers!

I just wanted to write this short post today, instead of our usual Mondays, so I can give you a couple of good news. First, now there is a __Subscribe__ form on the home page in case you want to get blog updates by email, instead of `RSS`. Second, since I have covered most of the important Swift topics already, starting next week I will begin writing about few of the important Apple frameworks, the __Metal framework__ and how to develop for it using `Swift`.

Until next time!
