  <p>
    I am one of the very first Udacity Code Reviewers, where I review iOS student project submissions. I am also one of their first Team Guides, acting as a team leader and senior iOS developer, coordinating weekly meetings and overseeing iOS project progress.

In 2013, after I had graduated two Coursera courses with distinction, I became a Community Teaching Assistant, where I continue to volunteer my time to the teaching staff, moderating discussions and assisting with student projects.

Having gone through an immersive iOS bootcamp in 2014, I have built iOS apps that used various frameworks and third party libraries.

You can read more about my current iOS activity on this blog, and see some of the iOS projects I'm working on <a href="https://github.com/mhorga" target="_blank">Github</a>. I am open to discuss about interesting opportunities in iOS development.
