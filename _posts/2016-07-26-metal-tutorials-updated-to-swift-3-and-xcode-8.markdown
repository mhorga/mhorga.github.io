layout: post

It's been a pretty quiet couple of months, first, because I was catching up with new content presented at __WWDC 2016__, and second, because I have updated all the parts in the `Using MetalKit` series to __Swift 3__, and adapted the code to work with __macOS Sierra (10.12)__ and with __iOS 10__, while using __Xcode 8__. The [updated source code](https://github.com/MetalKit/metal) is posted on `Github` as usual. Stay tuned for new content in the upcoming weeks.

Until next time!
