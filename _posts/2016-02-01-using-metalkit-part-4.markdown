Last time we looked at the `Metal Shading Language` basics. Before we look into more advanced topics, I just thought now is a good time to revisit what we have learned so far, especially about the _graphics pipeline_ which I admit, I might have gone too fast on that topic (thank you, anonymous reader, for your suggestion and valuable feedback!)

Lets look at the __graphics pipeline__ in more detail this time and I'll start with a piece of history here. It all started about a decade ago, when __shaders__ were introduced as a way for programmers to be able to influence the __fixed pipeline__ that existed until then. At the same time __floating point__ support was also introduced for `GPUs` and that gave birth to __GPGPU__ (general-purpose computing on graphics processing units).

Until next time!
