Start by creating a new _Single View Application_ project in _Xcode_. Go to the storyboard and select the view controller. On the Xcode menu, go to Editor --> Embed In --> Navigation Controller. You will notice now the view has a navigation bar. Inside the view drag a text area and two buttons. Set the necessary constraints. Write "What do you want to do next?" in the text area. Name one of the buttons "Go to screen 2" and the other "Go to screen 3". Now copy and paste four times the only view we have so far, so we can preserve the text area and the buttons we already set up.
