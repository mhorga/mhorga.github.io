title: What's new in graphics and games at WWDC 2016

Like every year, `June` is my favorite month of the year for several reasons, but __WWDC__ is most likely the top one! Watching the opening `Keynote` and the `Platforms State Of The Union` sessions yesterday revealed a plethora of new features and even a few new frameworks. In this article, I am only going to focus on what's new in the __Graphics and Games__ track.

Let's start with __Metal__, obviously. By far, the hottest and most anticipated feature is support for __tessellation__ which enables 3D apps and games to render more details by efficiently describing complex geometry to the `GPU`. Another feature is __Function Specialization__ helps with creating a collection of functions particularly optimized to handle material and light combinations in a scene. Also new this year are the __Resource Heaps and Memoryless Render Targets__ for finer-grained control of resource allocation and performance optimization. Finally, the __Metal System Trace__ is a `macOS`-only feature that helps us analyzing the graphics pipeline by profiling the interaction between the `CPU` and the `GPU`, thus helping us finding performance optimization points for Metal-based apps.


Stay tuned for more posts this week and have a great `WWDC`!
