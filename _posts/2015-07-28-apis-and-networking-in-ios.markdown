In this short introduction to _networking_ in iOS, we will access images from _Flickr_. To start, go to the [Flickr API](flickr.com/services/api) web page and create an _API Key_ for your app. Once you have your key created, let's start by creating a new _Single View Application_ in _Xcode_. In the storyboard add an image view, a label and a button. Put the necessary constraints and now let's the UI elements to our view controller.
