  <p>
    I am one of the very first Udacity iOS Code Reviewers, a Community Teaching Assistant at Coursera, and an independent iOS developer. 
    <br /><br />
    You can read more about my current iOS activity on this blog, and see some of the iOS projects I'm working on <a href="https://github.com/mhorga" target="_blank">Github</a>. I also published <a href="http://apple.co/1QPQzOM" target="_blank">Space Explorer</a> to the Apple app store, the first ever iOS app to show the previously unreleased NASA images from all the Apollo missions. 
    <br /><br />
    I am open to discuss about interesting opportunities in iOS development. You can reach out to me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mhorga" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/mhorga_" target="_blank">Twitter</a> or <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/3948730/marius" target="_blank">StackOverflow</a>.
