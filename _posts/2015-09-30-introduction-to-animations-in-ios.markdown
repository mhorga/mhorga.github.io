title: Introduction to animations in iOS
layout: post
---
I have learned so many great things about UI and animations in iOS from my good friend [@chrisslowik](https://twitter.com/chrisslowik) so I thought I should share my knowledge about that. In the most basic form, animations in iOS could reduce to simply manipulating the colors and size of UI items over a short period of time.

Let's start by creating a Single View Application project in Xcode. In the storyboard add a View object from the Object Library, align it to the top left corner of the view controller and in the Size Inspector set a relatively small size for it, like for example `50 x 50`. Finally, let's create an outlet named __square__ that connects it to the view controller.

Until next time!
