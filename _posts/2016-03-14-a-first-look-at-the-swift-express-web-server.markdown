title: A first look at the Swift Express web server
layout: post
---
This week we are going to look at a great `Swift` initiative -- the __Swift Express__ web server -- a project run by [Crossroad Labs](http://crossroadlabs.xyz). `Swift Express` is based on the power of the `Play Framework` and the simplicity of the `Express.js` framework which makes it great for `Swift`-based web applications. A powerful feature that sets `Swift Express` aside from other `Swift` backend solutions is the synchronous-vs-asynchronous functional approach. `OS X` and `iOS` developers also benefit from the familiar `Swift + Xcode` development environment they're already used to, and they will appreciate the fact that `Swift Express` provides an easy way to create `RESTful`,  `JSON` and `XML APIs` using `Swift`.

Alright, let's dive in and take a look at `Swift Express`.
