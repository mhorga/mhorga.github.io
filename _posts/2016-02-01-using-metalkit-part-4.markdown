Last time we looked at the `Metal Shading Language` basics. Before we look into more advanced topics, I thought now is a good time to revisit what we have learned so far, especially about the _graphics pipeline_ which I admit, I might have gone too fast on that topic (thank you, anonymous reader, for your suggestion and valuable feedback!)



Until next time!
