Let's pick up where we left off in [Part 13](http://mhorga.org/2016/05/25/using-metalkit-part-13.html). Using the same playground we worked on last time, we will learn about __noise__ today. From _Wikipedia_:

> `Noise` refers to any random fluctuations of data that makes the perception of an expected signal, difficult. `Value noise` is a type of noise commonly used as a procedural texture primitive in computer graphics. This method consists of the creation of a lattice of points which are assigned random values. The noise function then returns the interpolated number based on the values of the surrounding lattice points. Multiple octaves of this noise can be generated and then summed together in order to create a form of fractal noise.

The most obvious characteristic of noise is randomness. Since `MSL` does not provide a random function let's just create one ourselves. What we need is a random number between __[0, 1]__. We can get that by using the `fract` function which returns the fractional component of a number:

{% highlight swift %}float random(float2 p)
{
    return fract(sin(dot(p, float2(15.79, 81.93)) * 45678.9123));
}
{% endhighlight %}

The __noise()__ function will bilinearly interpolate a lattice (grid) and return a smoothed value. Bilinear interpolation allows us to transform our __1D__ `random` function to a value based on a __2D__ grid:

{% highlight swift %}float noise(float2 p)
{
    float2 i = floor(p);
    float2 f = fract(p);
    f = f * f * (3.0 - 2.0 * f);
    float bottom = mix(random(i + float2(0)), random(i + float2(1.0, 0.0)), f.x);
    float top = mix(random(i + float2(0.0, 1.0)), random(i + float2(1)), f.x);
    float t = mix(bottom, top, f.y);
    return t;
}
{% endhighlight %}

We first use __i__ to move along grid points and __f__ as an offset between the grid points. Then we calculate a __Cubic Hermite Spline__ with the formula `3f^2 - 2f^3` and which creates a S-shaped curve that has values between __[0, 1]__. Next we interpolate values along the bottom and top of the grid, and finally we interpolate the vertical line between those 2 horizontal points to get our final value for noise.

Next we create a __Fractional Brownian Motion__ function that calls our `noise()` function multiple times and adds up the results. 

{% highlight swift %}float fbm(float2 uv)
{
    float sum = 0;
    float amp = 0.7;
    for(int i = 0; i < 4; ++i)
    {
        sum += noise(uv) * amp;
        uv += uv * 1.2;
        amp *= 0.4;
    }
    return sum;
}
{% endhighlight %}

By adding various (four -- in this case) `octaves` of this noise at different amplitudes (as explained in the beginning), we can generate a simple cloud-like pattern. We have one more thing to do: inside the kernel replace all the lines after the one where `distance` is defined, with these lines:

{% highlight swift %}uv = fmod(uv + float2(timer * 0.2, 0), float2(width, height));
float t = fbm( uv * 3 );
output.write(distance < 0 ? float4(float3(t), 1) : float4(0), gid);
{% endhighlight %}

For fun, we add the `timer` uniform again to animate the content. The output image should look like this:

It looks cool, but still not realistic enough. To make it look even more realistic we need to learn about, and apply a texture. You can read more about [bilinear filtering](http://www.scratchapixel.com/old/lessons/3d-advanced-lessons/interpolation/bilinear-interpolation), about [value noise](http://www.scratchapixel.com/old/lessons/3d-advanced-lessons/noise-part-1/creating-a-simple-2d-noise) and about [Fractional Brownian motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_Brownian_motion) if you're interested. You can also see an example of the [Cubic Hermit Spline](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/mnrgw3yias). The [source code](https://github.com/MetalKit/metal) is posted on Github as usual.

Until next time!
