I couldn't be more excited than in that moment I saw the approval email from the review team in my inbox. So long story short, my [Space-Explorer](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/space-explorer/id1053165651) app is now alive in the `App Store`! Please take a look at it and leave me some useful feedback either in `iTunes` or on this blog, under the `Contact` section. Thanks, and I do hope you will enjoy it :-)

Until next time!
