This post is meant to be first, a quick update to let you know the new website [metalkit.org](metalkit.org) is now up and running but with only one post for now (more to come soon!) and second, I want to hear your feedback about the website design (I am open to new theme suggestions), as well as would love to hear your suggestions about new content and topics you would like to see covered next. You can use the [Contact](http://mhorga.org/contact/) form to send me your suggestions or feedback.

Until next time!
