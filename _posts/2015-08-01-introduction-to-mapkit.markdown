This time, we will look into how maps, locations and annotations work in iOS. Start by creating a new _Single View Application_ project in _Xcode_. Go to the storyboard and drag a _Map Kit View_ from the _Object Library_ on top the view controller. Make it fit the entire view and set the necessary constraints. There is one more thing we need to do in the storyboard, that is, create an outlet named __mapView__ for our _MKMapView_ object.
