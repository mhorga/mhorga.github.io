I have some really great news! [Caroline](https://twitter.com/carolinebegbie), a good friend of mine and a great `Metal` programmer, just launched her new video course through [Ray Wenderlich](https://www.raywenderlich.com/147786/new-course-beginning-metal). The first `2` lessons are free, however, to watch the remaining `13` videos you would need to purchase membership for at least one month. Each of the lessons provide the sample code used in the videos as well as challenges that you would need to solve preferably before moving on to the next lesson.
