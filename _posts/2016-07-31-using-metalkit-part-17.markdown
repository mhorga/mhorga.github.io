title: Metal Performance Shaders for the iPad playground
layout: post
---
As many of you might have seen at `WWDC 2016`, the new [Playground app for the iPad](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/408/) was a big hit! As an already playgrounds lover, for me it was even more than that. Now we are able to easily write `Swift` code on the iPad and run it with just a button tap. Today we are going to have fun with the __Metal Performance Shaders (MPS)__ since I have not discussed about them before, and also because it is so easy to use them on mobile devices. Oh yeah, this reminds me to warn you, the `MPS` framework only works on `iOS` and `tvOS` devices but we will look into a very handy way of writing the playground on a `macOS` device and share it with your mobile device through the `iCloud Drive`.

To start,

Until next time!
