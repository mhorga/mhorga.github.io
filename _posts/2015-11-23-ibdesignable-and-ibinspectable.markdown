Last time we looked at two of the features of the `Interface Builder`: the `Auto Layout` and the `Stack Views`. Today we will look at one last _trick_, the __@IBDesignable__ and __@IBInspectable__ attributes. Let's start by creating a new project in `Xcode`. We would like to have a custom view that consists of an image and some sort of subtitle for it. We are interested in seeing how they look at design time, before we even build and run the project. But stay with me here, you're so close to finding out how to do that!

Let's create a new class and name it __CustomView.swift__. Inside, let's create a `UIImageView` and a `UILabel` and then add them to our view:

{% highlight swift %}
class CustomView : UIView {
    
    var label: UILabel!
    var imageView: UIImageView!
    
    override init(frame: CGRect) {
        super.init(frame: frame)
        addSubviews()
    }
    
    required init?(coder aDecoder: NSCoder) {
        super.init(coder: aDecoder)
        addSubviews()
    }
    
    func addSubviews() {
        imageView = UIImageView()
        addSubview(imageView)
        label = UILabel()
        addSubview(label)
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Let's also add the __layoutSubviews()__ method to configure the image and label properties: 

{% highlight swift %}
override func layoutSubviews() {
    super.layoutSubviews()
    layer.borderWidth = 0.5
    layer.cornerRadius = 5
    imageView.frame = self.bounds
    imageView.contentMode = UIViewContentMode.ScaleAspectFit
    label.frame = CGRectMake(0, bounds.size.height - 40, bounds.size.width, 40)
    label.backgroundColor = UIColor.blackColor().colorWithAlphaComponent(0.1)
    label.textAlignment = .Center
    label.textColor = .grayColor()
}
{% endhighlight %}

In the storyboard let's add a `UIView` and in `Identity Inspector` change its _class_ to __CustomView__, and finally set constraints for it, like this:

The imageview and label are displayed now, but they are both empty! Here comes the magic. Modify the class signature to include the __@IBDesignable__ attribute and add the following method:

{% highlight swift %}
@IBDesignable class CustomView : UIView {
    
    override func prepareForInterfaceBuilder() {
        super.prepareForInterfaceBuilder()
        label.text = " iPhone 6s Plus"
        let url = "http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03058/iphone_6_3058505b.jpg"
        imageView.image = UIImage(data: NSData(contentsOfURL: NSURL(string: url)!)!)
    }
...
{% endhighlight %}

Now go to the storyboard and, voila! There is an image and text underneath. And all this was accomplished by using the `IBDesignable` attribute. There is a catch about the __prepareForInterfaceBuilder()__ method though. Although itâ€™s compiled for runtime, code called from `prepareForInterfaceBuilder` never gets called except by the `Interface Builder` at design time, so if you run the app nothing will displayed at this time. Go ahead and see for yourself.

So let's comment out that method:

{% highlight swift %}
//    override func prepareForInterfaceBuilder() {
//        super.prepareForInterfaceBuilder()
//        label.text = " iPhone 6s Plus"
//        let url = "http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03058/iphone_6_3058505b.jpg"
//        imageView.image = UIImage(data: NSData(contentsOfURL: NSURL(string: url)!)!)
//    }
{% endhighlight %}

Next, let's make use of the other attribute we mentioned in the beginning, __@IBInspectable__. So let's add this last piece of code we need: 

{% highlight swift %}
@IBInspectable var text: String? {
    didSet { label.text = text }
}

@IBInspectable var image: UIImage? {
    didSet { imageView.image = image }
}
{% endhighlight %}

What this does is to allow us to set values for variables in `Attributes Inspector` so if you go there now, you will notice a new section appears for our `UIView`, named `CustomView`, under `Attributes Inspector`, and it has two fields: __Text__ and __Image__. If you want, you could download that `iPhone` image from the `URL` we used above (or any other image you want) and add it to the project. Next, if you click the `Image` drop down menu, you should be able to choose it, and it will be displayed in real time, like this:

Lastly, write `iPhone 6s Plus` (or anything else you want) and it will show on the label on top of the image, in real time as well:

These are two powerful attributes that are very useful when designing your apps, without having to actually build and run your app. There are unlimited opportunities for using these attributes. Imagine playing with numbers that show a spinning wheel completion in real time, or color that change as you are watching them live.

Until next time!
