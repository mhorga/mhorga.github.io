<div class="py2">
  
  <p>I have more than 8 years of experience with system administration, support, integration and development. In the last couple of years I started with iOS and Watch development. I have built iOS apps that used Core Data, iCloud, Core Location, Core Motion, HealthKit, MapKit, WatchKit, SpriteKit, SceneKit, AV Foundation, UIKit, Touch ID, Apple Pay, Parse, JSON, HTTP, and interfaced with APIs such as Instagram, Twitter, Google Maps, Forecast, and so on. I am currently open to new job opportunities.
