I know this is not the kind of article you were expecting, so I am sorry for this. I lost my job a few days ago and along with it, the only chance I had to return back to __US__. I got a couple of other bad news since then, including one this morning, so since there are so many negative vibes around my career these days, I decided to take a week off and enjoy the time with my family, away from all this non sense. I promise I'll be back rested and more __Metal__-aware than ever.

Until next time!
