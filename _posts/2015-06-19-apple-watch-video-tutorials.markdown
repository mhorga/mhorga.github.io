There are not yet too many valuable video tutorials out there for __Apple Watch__ development but I am going to share my feedback below about the top ones I found available. 

The [Developing for Apple Watch First Look](http://www.lynda.com/WatchKit-tutorials/Developing-Apple-Watch-First-Look/382584-2.html) course at _Lynda.com_ is a short course (2.5h). It is a low cost option, if you have a monthly paid membership. The course barely scratches the surface of _Apple Watch_ development and there are no assignments to do. 

The [WatchKit Series](http://www.raywenderlich.com/video-tutorials#watchkit) video tutorial at _RayWenderlich.com_ is another low cost option for which one needs to have a monthly paid membership. The course duration is also below 3 hours. There are short challenges however at the end of few of the lessons. 

The [Complete Apple Watch Developer Course](https://www.udemy.com/complete-apple-watch-developer-course/) and the [Apple Watch - go from Newbie to Pro by building 15 apps](https://www.udemy.com/how-to-make-a-freaking-apple-watch-app-with-swift-tutorial/) course, both at _Udemy.com_ are very detailed courses that contain many hours of video content. The cost is the highest amongst all the courses: $199 each. At the end of each section there is a short quiz but I was hoping to also see some assignments for that price.

Finally, I left the [Apple Watch Course](http://www.bitfountain.io/courses/iwatch-course) from _Bitfountain.com_ at the end of my survey because there is a lot to say about it. Just like the _Udemy_ course, the __Bitfountain__ course also contains hours and hours of video content. The huge advantage though is that the price is only __$99__ and you can even get it at a discounted price on special occasions. The course is taught by __Eliot Arntz__, the same great teacher we’ve met in other _iOS_ courses in the past. Eliot makes himself available for course related questions on various media channels such as Twitter, Facebook or even by email. Another great advantage is having challenges throughout the course so you can practice the concepts you learned. An outstanding feature that should be mentioned is that the course is updated as new versions of the SDK or Xcode are released. At the time of writing this review the Xcode version Eliot used was 6.3.1 while the latest one is now 6.3.2 (only a couple of weeks behind)! What I always liked about Bitfountain courses is Eliot’s modular approach at presenting new concepts. He first starts with explaining the _Apple Watch_ architecture, then continues with introducing the UI elements in great detail (Labels, Buttons, Switches, Sliders). He then continues with positioning of the UI elements in the storyboard and using of the _Interface Controller_. In the next chapter we are building a complex music app using the _WatchKit_ and _AVFoundation_ frameworks. We then proceed to a more advanced task list application that uses _Core Data_ and table views. In the final project we build a weather app using _Core Location_, _MapKit_ and accessing an external API for the weather data feed. I’m very happy to have chosen _Bitfountain_’s course as my main go-to source of information about _WatchKit_ as well as about _iOS_. Without any doubt, this course is offering us the best bang for the buck!
