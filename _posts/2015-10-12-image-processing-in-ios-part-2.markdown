title: Image processing in iOS part 2
layout: post
---
Last week we looked into how we could store pixel information in proper data structures. This week we will continue the image processing topic by looking into how to convert a `UIImage` into a `Core Graphics` image, change some pixel values, and then convert it back into a `UIImage`. In this part of the series we will only look at converting the `UIImage` into a `CGImage` and then back into a `UIImage`, leaving the fun part for next week.
